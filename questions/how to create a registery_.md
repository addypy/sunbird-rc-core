To create a registry using Sunbird RC, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Sunbird RC repository**: Clone the [Sunbird RC Github repository](https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core) to your local machine by running the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the `sunbird-rc-core` directory and install the required dependencies. For example, if you are using Maven, run:

```sh
$ cd sunbird-rc-core
$ mvn clean install
```

3. **Configure the registry**: Configure the registry by updating the configuration files located in the `src/main/resources` directory. You may need to set up database connections, authentication settings, and other configurations specific to your use case.

4. **Run the application**: Run the Sunbird RC application using your preferred method (e.g., running it as a standalone Java application or deploying it to a web server like Tomcat).

5. **Interact with the registry**: You can interact with the registry using the provided APIs or by using the [Registry CLI](https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core/blob/main/tools/cli/readme.md). The CLI allows you to create and manage registry instances, entities, and relationships.

Here's an example of how to use the Registry CLI:

```sh
$ cd sunbird-rc/core/tools/cli
```

Then, follow the [getting started guide](https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev/developer-documentation/installation-guide) to learn how to use the CLI.

By following these steps, you can create and manage a registry using the Sunbird RC framework. For more information and detailed instructions, refer to the [Sunbird RC documentation](https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev/).
