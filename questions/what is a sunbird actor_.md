A Sunbird actor is a specialized class in the Sunbird RC framework that extends the `BaseActor` class and is responsible for handling specific tasks within the system. Actors are used to process incoming messages and perform operations in a concurrent and distributed manner.

In the provided code blocks, the `OSActor` class is an example of a Sunbird actor. It extends the `BaseActor` class and overrides the `onReceive` method to handle incoming messages:

```java
public class OSActor extends BaseActor {
    private boolean elasticSearchEnabled;
    public ObjectMapper objectMapper;

    @Override
    protected void onReceive(MessageProtos.Message message) throws Throwable {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `onReceive` method is responsible for processing the incoming messages and performing the required actions. In the case of the `OSActor`, it processes the `OSEvent` and sends messages to Elasticsearch if enabled.

To create a Sunbird actor, you need to extend the `BaseActor` class and override the `onReceive` method to handle the specific tasks you want the actor to perform. You can also override other methods like `onSuccess` and `onFailure` if needed.

For example, if you want to create a new actor to handle document uploads, you can create a class like this:

```java
public class DocumentUploadActor extends BaseActor {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(MessageProtos.Message request) throws Throwable {
        // Handle document upload requests here
    }
}
```

Then, implement the logic for handling document uploads inside the `onReceive` method.

You can find more examples of Sunbird actors in the provided code blocks, such as the `Indexer` class and the `DocumentUploadActor` class in the `plugins/sample-external-plugin-2` directory.
