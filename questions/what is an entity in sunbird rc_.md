An entity in Sunbird RC is a representation of a real-world object or concept, such as a person, organization, or credential. Entities in Sunbird RC are stored in the registry and can have attributes, relationships, and metadata associated with them. They can be created, updated, and retrieved using the provided APIs and tools.

Entities in Sunbird RC are represented by the `EntityDto` class, which can be found in the [EntityDto.java](https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core/blob/main/java/registry/src/main/java/dev/sunbirdrc/registry/model/dto/EntityDto.java) file:

```java
package dev.sunbirdrc.registry.model.dto;

public class EntityDto {
    private String id;

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}
```

This class provides a simple data structure for storing an entity's ID. In practice, entities can have additional attributes, relationships, and metadata depending on the specific use case and registry configuration.
