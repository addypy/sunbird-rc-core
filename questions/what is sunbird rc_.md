Sunbird RC (Registry Core) is an open-source software framework for rapidly building electronic registries, enabling attestation capabilities, and building verifiable credentialing with minimal effort. It provides a shared digital infrastructure that allows authorized data repositories to publish appropriate data and metadata about a user or entity, along with a link to the repository, in a digitally signed form. Sunbird RC enables data owners to provide authorized access to other users or entities in a controlled manner for digital verification and usage.

The Sunbird RC framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to create custom plugins and integrations for various use cases. It provides a set of core components and APIs for building electronic registries, managing attestations, and generating verifiable credentials. Some key features of Sunbird RC include:

1. A flexible data model for defining and storing entities and their relationships.
2. Support for digital signatures and cryptographic operations to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
3. APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and querying entities in the registry.
4. Support for extensible plugins and integrations with external systems and services.
5. A sample UI for demonstrating the capabilities of the Sunbird RC APIs.
