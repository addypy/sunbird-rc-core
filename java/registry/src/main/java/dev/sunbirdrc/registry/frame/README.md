# sunbird-rc-core/java/registry/src/main/java/dev/sunbirdrc/registry/frame

This directory contains a single file, `FrameContext.java`, which is part of the Sunbird RC Core project. Sunbird RC is an open-source software framework for rapidly building electronic registries, enabling attestation capabilities, and building verifiable credentialing with minimal effort.

## FrameContext.java

`FrameContext.java` is a Java class that serves as the core component for managing the context of a frame in the registry. It is responsible for maintaining the state of the frame, including any data and metadata associated with it. This context is essential for the proper functioning of the registry, as it ensures that all operations are performed within the correct context, and that the integrity of the data is maintained.

### Usage

`FrameContext.java` is used internally by the Sunbird RC Core framework to manage the context of frames within the registry. Developers using the Sunbird RC Core framework do not need to interact with this class directly, as it is automatically managed by the framework.

However, developers who wish to extend or modify the functionality of the Sunbird RC Core framework may need to interact with the `FrameContext.java` class. In this case, it is crucial to understand the role of the `FrameContext.java` class and its relationship with other components within the framework.

### Key Functions

Some of the key functions provided by the `FrameContext.java` class include:

- Initializing the context for a frame with the proper data and metadata
- Managing the state of the frame, including any updates or modifications to the data
- Ensuring that all operations are performed within the correct context, preserving the integrity of the data and metadata associated with the frame

### Conclusion

The `FrameContext.java` class is an essential component of the Sunbird RC Core framework, responsible for managing the context of frames within the registry. By maintaining the correct context for each frame, `FrameContext.java` ensures that the registry functions properly and preserves the integrity of the data and metadata associated with each frame.
